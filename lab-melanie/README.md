2. `cd` to the `back-end` folder and run `npm i`
3. Use `npm run start` to run the app locally (make sure a local Mongo database is running) on `localhost:3000`.
4. Verify your server is running using a local `.env` file before launching the front-end app.

#### Front-end
1. Once you've downloaded this repo's code, `cd` to the repository directory and run `npm i`
2. Use `npm run watch` to run the app locally with a local `.dev.env` file.
3. Navigate to `localhost:8080` to sign up for the app and subsequently sign in. Create a profile by navigating to the `profile settings` link on the nav bar.
